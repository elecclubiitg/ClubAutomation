1. Slab location detection using qr code.
2. Lights on/off  miniature model using relays.
Or
1 sensor inside and 1 sensor outside keeping track of person entering or leaving the room and switch on/off lights accordingly 
3. Ac on/off controller using servo motor based on off remote. Or
2 sensors 1 inside and 1 outside to maintain inside temperature based on outside temperature.
4. Rfid door lock materials released.

Minutes
1. Discussion about the sensor slab project using QR code reader and IR Sensor.
2. Introductory teaching on how the IR Sensor works. A sample code for the same was discussed.

Sample Code:

int IRSensor = 2;                   // connect IR Sensor to Arduino pin 2
int LED = 13;                       // conect LED to Arduino pin 13
void setup() {
  Serial.begin(9600);  
  pinMode (IRSensor, INPUT);        // sensor pin INPUT
  pinMode (LED, OUTPUT);            // Led pin OUTPUT
}
void loop(){
  int statusSensor = digitalRead (IRSensor);
  if (statusSensor == 1){
    digitalWrite(LED, LOW);         // LED LOW or LED OFF when nothing is in front of IR Sensor
  }else{
    digitalWrite(LED, HIGH);        // LED High or LED ON when an object is brought near the IR Sensor
  }
 }

 3. A brief introduction to RPI Microcontroller.
